# Release Notes

This page summarizes published Epusdt releases using the repository's actual GitHub releases, tags, release notes, and compare diffs.

## Scope and Source Rules

- Primary source: GitHub Releases in `GMwalletApp/epusdt`
- Supplementary source: tag compare diffs and merged commit messages
- This page avoids inventing features that are not visible in release or code history

## v0.9.4

- Release tag: `v0.9.4`
- Published at: `2026-04-28T16:37:20Z`
- Official release note: `Full Changelog: https://github.com/GMWalletApp/epusdt/compare/v0.9.3...v0.9.4`

### User-visible changes

- TRON payment scanning is back on a block-based listener path in current source history, so the temporary revert of the newer TRON flow is no longer the effective upstream state.
- Follow-up payment-processing fixes adjusted order notification behavior after successful payment handling.
- Hosted checkout entry now redirects into the SPA cashier flow instead of rendering a dedicated server-side HTML template directly from `/pay/checkout-counter/:trade_id`.

### Deployment and configuration changes

- The hosted checkout flow now relies on the SPA-based `www/` delivery path instead of the older dedicated `static/` checkout asset path.
- The Docker image was later cleaned up to remove redundant `static` copy steps that no longer match the active SPA checkout delivery path.

### API changes

- `GET /pay/checkout-counter/:trade_id` now behaves as a redirect entry for the cashier SPA.
- Current source exposes `GET /pay/checkout-counter-resp/:trade_id` as the JSON response endpoint used by the new SPA checkout flow.
- No new merchant signature field or callback contract was introduced in this release.

### Evidence used

- GitHub release `v0.9.4`

## v0.9.3

- Release tag: `v0.9.3`
- Published at: `2026-04-25T10:50:34Z`
- Official release note: `Full Changelog: https://github.com/GMWalletApp/epusdt/compare/v0.9.2...v0.9.3`

### User-visible changes

- Fixed the root route after installation so `GET /` consistently serves the SPA instead of being intercepted by the backend root handler.
- Install mode still redirects the root path to `/install`, so first-time setup flow remains intact.

### Deployment and configuration changes

- No new public environment variable or deployment flag was published for this release.
- The main runtime route behavior was adjusted so installed instances land on the web app more reliably.

### API changes

- No new public API route was introduced in this release.
- Root backend routing changed from a catch-all `Any("/")` style handler to a `POST("/")` backend handler, leaving normal browser `GET /` traffic to the SPA.

### Evidence used

- GitHub release `v0.9.3`
- Compare diff `v0.9.2...v0.9.3`
- Commits including `95879e3`, merge tag `67263da`

## v0.9.2

### User-visible changes

- Docker deployment examples remain aligned with the current `gmwallet/epusdt:latest` image reference.

### Deployment and configuration changes

## v0.9.1

- Release tag: `v0.9.1`
- Published at: `2026-04-22T18:29:39Z`

### User-visible changes

- Built-in install wizard: first run without a usable config file now launches a web-based setup flow instead of failing. The current form focuses on `app_name`, `app_uri`, bind address/port, runtime path, log path, order expiration, and callback retry settings.
- Docker image now supports direct pull with `docker pull gmwallet/epusdt:latest`; no `.env` mount needed for initial deployment.

### Deployment and configuration changes

- The install wizard writes `.env` automatically on first submit; subsequent restarts skip the wizard and boot normally.
- `docker-compose.yaml` volume mount for `.env` is now optional — omit it for a clean wizard-based first run.

### API changes

- No new public API route in this release.

## Notes for Maintainers

For future releases, the most useful release format is:

1. User-visible changes
2. Deployment or config changes
3. API or schema changes
4. Upgrade notes or breaking changes

That structure maps cleanly to both docs readers and integrators.
