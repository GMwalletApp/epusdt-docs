# Release Notes

This page summarizes published Epusdt releases using the repository's actual GitHub releases, tags, release notes, and compare diffs.

## Scope and Source Rules

- Primary source: GitHub Releases in `GMwalletApp/epusdt`
- Supplementary source: tag compare diffs and merged commit messages
- This page avoids inventing features that are not visible in release or code history

## v0.9.1

- Release tag: `v0.9.1`
- Published at: `2026-04-22T18:29:39Z`

### User-visible changes

- Built-in install wizard: first run without a `.env` file now launches a web-based setup flow instead of failing. Fill in database, API token, and domain in the browser — no manual file editing required.
- Docker image now supports direct pull with `docker pull gmwallet/epusdt:latest`; no `.env` mount needed for initial deployment.

### Deployment and configuration changes

- The install wizard writes `.env` automatically on first submit; subsequent restarts skip the wizard and boot normally.
- `docker-compose.yaml` volume mount for `.env` is now optional — omit it for a clean wizard-based first run.

### API changes

- No new public API route in this release.

## Notes for Maintainers

For future releases, the most useful release format is:

1. User-visible changes
2. Deployment or config changes
3. API or schema changes
4. Upgrade notes or breaking changes

That structure maps cleanly to both docs readers and integrators.
